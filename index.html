        <h2>Mountainbikes</h2>
        <div>
        <p>As an avid outdoor enthusiast seeking adventure in nature, a mountain bike is the perfect choice for you. It gives you the freedom to go off-road and master all types of terrain. 
            From relaxed off-road fun to action-packed challenges in rough terrain, the mountain bike offers you everything you need. 
            The best part is that you only have to choose the right model for you.
            Mountain bikes differ from everyday bikes and road bikes in their geometry and specific components such as large-volume tyres, robust frames, suspension systems, powerful disc brakes and derailleurs with mountain-ready gearing. 
            There is a wide range of different MTB designs, each designed for specific purposes.
            Modern MTBs have wheels in 27.5 inch and 29 inch sizes. The smaller version offers more agility and manoeuvrability, while the larger wheels offer more traction and better grip on uneven surfaces. The tyre width varies between 2.1 and 2.5 inches. For grip and traction on extremely soft surfaces like snow or sand, you can even go for a fatbike with a tyre width of up to 5 inches.
            There are also different types of suspension: "Fully MTBs" have full suspension, while hardtail mountain bikes only have a suspension fork. More suspension provides more comfort, grip and traction, which is especially important in challenging terrain. The additional weight of the Fully MTB is less important than the increased riding comfort and safety. Hardtails, on the other hand, are designed for less rough terrain and are significantly lighter and require less maintenance.                
            The frame of a mountain bike is usually made of aluminium or carbon. Aluminium frames can also be found on more affordable models, while carbon frames are more expensive but also very light. Frames made of titanium or steel are characterised by special aesthetics, durability and lively handling.
            There are also different types of MTBs that are designed for specific uses. For example, cross-country bikes are ideal when fast progress is a priority and unpaved trails rather than difficult terrain are involved. These bikes often have low suspension travel (around 100 mm) and are usually hardtail MTBs, but increasingly also full mountain bikes.
            Find the right mountain bike that is perfectly suited to your body and the area of use. Discover the adventure in nature and enjoy the feeling of freedom and independence on your new mountain bike.

        <h2>Road bikes</h2>
        <div>
        <p>A road bike is a great choice for someone who wants to go fast on the road. Road bikes are built specifically for speed and efficiency. 
            They have narrow tyres, a lightweight design and a sporty riding position that allow for effective power transfer. 
            Road bikes offer many advantages, especially for those who like to ride fast on the road and compete. The advantages of road bikes are speed, lightweight construction, efficiency and the ability to push your body to the limit. 
            Road bikes are designed for speed and offer an aerodynamic design, narrow tyres and efficient power transmission. This allows riders to reach higher speeds than with other types of bikes. 
            Road bikes usually have a lightweight design that makes it easier for the rider to accelerate and control the bike. This can also help reduce fatigue and strain on the rider. 
            Road bikes often have special gears and cogs that allow riders to go fast with minimal effort. This allows riders to cover longer distances faster and more efficiently. 
            Riding a road bike is a great way to build endurance and fitness. By exercising regularly on a road bike, riders can improve their physical performance and burn calories. 
            Road bikes are a popular choice for road races, time trials and other competitions. If you want to participate in competitions, a road bike is an essential tool.
            There are many different types of road bikes. The two most important are race and endurance racing bikes. Race bikes are characterised by a low overall weight and high stiffness. 
            They are perfect for fast-paced races. Endurance bikes, on the other hand, are more comfortable and offer a more upright riding position suitable for longer distances. 
            Do you want a road bike for competitions or rather for longer distances and a comfortable ride?
